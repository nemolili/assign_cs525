The goal of this assignment is to implement a simple storage manager - a module that is capable of reading blocks from a file on disk into memory and writing blocks from memory to a file on disk. The storage manager deals with pages (blocks) of fixed size (PAGE_SIZE). In addition to reading and writing pages from a file, it provides methods for creating, opening, and closing files.

How to use:
		1.Type the command "make" in the terminal;
		2.run the executable file in the directory;

The structure is :
		dberror.c
		dberror.h
		storage_mgr.c
		storage_mgr.h
		test_assign1_1.c
		test_helper.h
		Makefile
		README.txt
